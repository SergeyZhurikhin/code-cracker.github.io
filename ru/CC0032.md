# Cause

A type has a disposable field (a field that implements `IDisposable`). This field
is being assigned on the type construction through a method call. It may be
possible that the enclosing type owns the object and should then dispose it as
well, implementing `IDisposible` itself (if it does not yet implement yet).

# Example

Assuming class `D` implements `IDisposable`:

{% highlight csharp %}
class TypeName
{
    private D field = D.Create();
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Code fix

A code fix will be presented to you that will transform the code, it will implement
`IDisposable` if the type has not implemented it yet, and add a call do `Dispose`
on the field.

{% highlight csharp %}
class TypeName : System.IDisposable
{
    private D field = D.Create();

    public void Dispose()
    {
        field.Dispose();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
