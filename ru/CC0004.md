# Cause

An empty catch block suppress all errors and shouldn't be used. <br />
If the error is expected consider logging it or changing the control flow such that it is explicit.

# Example

{% highlight csharp %}
try
{
    // do something
}
catch
{
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Code fix

You will have the choice to remove the Try-Catch block altogether, with the option to place a *TODO* message with a link to MSDN on how to use try-catch statements. You will also have the choice to add an Exception class and throw it:

{% highlight csharp %}
try
{
    // do something
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw;
}
{% endhighlight %}
