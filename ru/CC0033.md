# Cause

A type has a disposable field (a field that implements `IDisposable`). This field
is being assigned on the type construction by constructing a new object. It is very
likely that the enclosing type owns the object and should then dispose it,
implementing `IDisposible` itself (if it does not yet implement yet).

# Example

Assuming class `D` implements `IDisposable`:

{% highlight csharp %}
class TypeName
{
    private D field = new D();
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Code fix

A code fix will be presented to you that will transform the code, it will implement
`IDisposable` if the type has not implemented it yet, and add a call do `Dispose`
on the field.

{% highlight csharp %}
class TypeName : System.IDisposable
{
    private D field = new D();

    public void Dispose()
    {
        field.Dispose();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

* [CC0029](CC0029.html) - Disposable should call `SuppressFinalize`
* [CC0032](CC0032.html) - same rule, but field is being assigned by a method call
