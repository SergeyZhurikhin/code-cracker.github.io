# Cause

Classes implementing IDisposable should call the `GC.SuppressFinalize` method in their finalize method to avoid any finalizer from being called.  
This rule should be followed even if the class doesn't have a finalizer as a derived class could have one.

# Example

{% highlight csharp %}
public class MyType : System.IDisposable
{
	public void Dispose()
	{
		var x = 123;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Code fix

A code fix will be presented to you that will transform the code:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class MyType : System.IDisposable
{
	public void Dispose()
	{
		var x = 123;
		GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
