# Cause

Usage of an implicit type helps improve readability of the code. Code depending on types for their readability should be refactored with better variable names or by introducing well-named methods.

# Example

{% highlight csharp %}
int a = 10;
{% endhighlight %}

# Code fix

A code fix will be presented to you that will transform the code:

{% highlight csharp %}
var a = 10;
{% endhighlight %}
