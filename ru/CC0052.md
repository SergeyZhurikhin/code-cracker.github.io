# Cause

A field that is only assigned when declared or in the constructor
can be made reaonly.
A readonly field cannot be assigned anywhere else after the object
is created, making it immutable.

# Example


{% highlight csharp %}
class Foo
{
    private int i = 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Code fix

A code fix will be presented to you that will transform the code:

{% highlight csharp %}
class Foo
{
    private readonly int i = 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
